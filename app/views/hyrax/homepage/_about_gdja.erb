<p>The Greek Digital Journal Archive (GDJA) -- Το Αρχείο Ελληνικών Ψηφιοποιημένων Περιοδικών (ΑΕΨΠ) -- is a growing consortium of libraries and archives in North America and Europe committed to open online access of their historic journal and newspaper collections in Greek and other languages. A website/global index unites scattered resources from many institutions into an international resource and bridges the gap between a diverse user community and multiple repositories by means of a digital union catalog with full text access to the materials including images and searchable descriptive, structural and administrative metadata.</p>

<p>The GDJA  makes collections available that are often restricted from public access and offers a unified resource for all or most journals and newspapers published 1800-1949 with a continual moving wall as items are released from copyright restrictions. The collections will comprise journals and newspapers in the humanities and the social sciences published in Greece or among Greek diaspora communities outside of Greece during the Ottoman period and after the War of Independence.</p>
